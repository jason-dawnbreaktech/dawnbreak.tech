I'm an IT Systems Engineer/Technomancer with lots of experience tinkering, building, and optimizing the tech stack from top to bottom. Whether it’s upgrading servers, engineering cloud solutions, or conducting security audits, I’ve been hands-on with just about every layer of IT and have a genuine love for computers.

My professional track record includes leading infrastructure overhauls, migrating critical systems, and delivering custom solutions tailored to meet modern security standards like NIST and CMMC. I’ve got a deep appreciation for cybersecurity, IAM, and keeping networks locked down tighter than a drum (when necessary!).

Outside of work, I’ve been building computers for over 12 years. I spend most of my free time bouldering, coding, gaming, or writing my first novel.
